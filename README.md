# Figure_Skating_Scoring_Bias

This repository is a resource connected to the research paper "Nationality Bias in Figure Skating Following the Introduction of the International Judging System: A Statistical Analysis of Four Major Figure Skating Events".

It contains code of the analysis completed for the paper in PDF and RMD format as well as a jupyter notebook file of the python script used to scrape the data from the web.

Hopefully this can be a helpful resource for those who want build upon our work.
